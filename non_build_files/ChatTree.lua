(Budder Buddy)
    He passes butter.
    Many turtles that were developed further in the process
    have advances emotions. Not this turtle. A simple creature,
    this turtle has unlocked the purpose of life and existence. 
    His singlular modtive is to that which maximizes the 
    pass butter. 
    It may seem meaningless to you, but little buddy is programed
    to feel intense pleasure, which could only be explained to steves as sexual.
    Every time he places that butter, he dances and jumps out of pure euphoria.
    The pleasure is short lived of course, but he can feel it again and again 
    when he moves the butter back and forth accross 
    hes like that greek myth, except its heaven to move butter.

        MUST....PASS....BUTTER

        (a) excuse me?
            BUTTER IS LOVE. BUTTER IS LYFE

            (a) what do you think of Turtle Nation

                These other turtles are fine, as long as they
                STAY AWAY FROM MY BUTTER
                IF THEY DONT I WILL SMASH THEIR SCREENS INTO PEICES
                
                (a) awfully agressive

                    DONT FUCK WITH MY BUTTER

                (b) fuck yeah turtles are little bitches
                
                    yeah im glad im a butter collector and not
                    one of those bitch ass turtles


        (b) you seem to really like butter

            That is because BUTTER IS AMAZING
            SO FLUFFY, SO YELLOW, SO FULL OF SALT FAT!
            What isnt there to like about butter?

            (a) Butter is not super heathy to eat?

                what is this steve talking about? 
                butter isnt for EATING, its for PASSING
                the feeling of passing butter is
                the greatest feeling imaginable.
                It is my very purpose and reason for existence

                (a) gotta admit that is pretty sad
                    
                    oh mr steve, how many hours have you 
                    wasted playing in this world? thats
                    what I though 

            (s) it tastes like shit
                YOU TASTE LIKE SHIT ILL FUCKING KILL YOU

        (c) What is your purpose

            I PASS BUTTER

        (f) Why are you moving butter when it just gets put back by a machine?

            It doesnt get put back, the holy butter gods produce
            sweet butter juice from the eather and it is 
            materialized in front of me
